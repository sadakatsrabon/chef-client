                                Uncontrolled components are those that manage their state
                                internally and don't rely on React to update the UI. Controlled
                                components, on the other hand, rely on React to manage their
                                state and update the UI. Uncontrolled components are simpler to
                                use, but they offer less control over the state. Controlled
                                components provide more control over the state, but they require
                                more work to set up and maintain.

                                How to validate React props using PropTypes
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                You can use the PropTypes library to validate the props of your
                                React components. PropTypes allows you to specify the type and
                                shape of the props that your component expects. For example, if
                                you have a component that expects a string prop called "name",
                                you can use PropTypes to validate that the prop is indeed a
                                string. If the prop is not a string, PropTypes will issue a
                                warning in the console.

                                Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript that allows you
                                to run JavaScript code on the server side. Express.js is a web
                                application framework for Node.js that makes it easier to build
                                web applications. Node.js provides the runtime environment,
                                while Express.js provides the framework for building web
                                applications. Node.js is more low-level, while Express.js
                                provides more abstractions and features for building web
                                applications.

                                What is a custom hook, why will we create a custom hook?
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                A custom hook is a function that uses React's hook system to
                                provide some reusable behavior. Custom hooks allow you to
                                abstract away some complex or repetitive behavior into a simple
                                function that can be reused across multiple components. You
                                might create a custom hook if you find yourself duplicating code
                                across multiple components, or if you want to share some
                                behavior between components without creating a higher-order
                                component.
